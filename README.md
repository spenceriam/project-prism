## 🚀 Development Status

Project Prism Protocol has completed its initial MVP Core Mechanics phase with the following progress:

### Completed
- ✅ Engine Setup (Basic Babylon.js structure, webpack configuration, asset loading pipeline)
- ✅ Player Controller (First-person camera, movement physics, collision detection, input management)
- ✅ Weapon System (Base weapon architecture, weapon switching, projectile physics, hitscan/projectile types)
- ✅ Enemy AI (Enemy base class, pathfinding, state machine, perception system, attack mechanics)
- ✅ TypeScript Error Resolution (Fixed all TypeScript errors across the codebase)
- ✅ Performance Optimization Systems:
  - Asset Streaming System
  - Level of Detail (LOD) system
  - Texture Compression
  - Memory Usage Monitoring
  - Physics Optimization
  - Performance Manager
  - Auto-quality adjustment

### In Progress
- 🔄 Environment: Training Facility (Completed design, basic geometry, interactive elements, lighting)
- 🔄 User Interface (Completed HUD elements, menu system, objective tracking)
- 🔄 Audio System (Completed spatial audio engine, weapon sounds, movement sounds)

### Next Steps
