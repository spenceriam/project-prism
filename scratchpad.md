# Project Prism Protocol - AI Agent Scratchpad

This document serves as a working area for the AI agent to record thoughts, plans, and track progress during development. The AI will update this document throughout the development process.

## Current Task Analysis

### Enemy AI Implementation (Completed)

We've successfully implemented the Enemy AI system for Project Prism Protocol, completing all tasks in the Enemy AI section of the TODO.md file. The implementation follows the component-based architecture defined in the PRD and maintains the project's focus on performance optimization for browser-based gameplay.

Key components implemented:
- EnemyBase class with state machine architecture
- StandardGuard implementation with patrol, alert, attack, and search behaviors
- PathfindingSystem for enemy navigation
- EnemyManager for spawning and controlling enemies

### Next Development Focus

According to TODO.md, the next sections to implement are:
1. Environment: Training Facility
2. User Interface
3. Audio System (remaining tasks)

The Training Facility environment is a logical next step since we now have enemies that need an environment to navigate and interact with.

## Implementation Plan for Training Facility

1. Design the training facility layout
   - Create a modular approach for level design
   - Define training zones (shooting range, movement course, etc.)

2. Implement basic level geometry
   - Create reusable environment components
   - Set up collision meshes for player and enemy interaction

3. Create interactive training elements
   - Target practice systems
   - Timed challenges
   - Tutorial triggers

4. Design lighting system
   - Implement indoor lighting with appropriate shadows
   - Create atmosphere suitable for a training facility

5. Add environmental objects and props
   - Furniture, equipment, signage
   - Decorative elements for visual interest

6. Implement material system
   - Create reusable materials for environment assets
   - Optimize textures for performance

7. Performance optimizations
   - Implement occlusion culling
   - Set up level of detail (LOD) for complex objects
   - Optimize draw calls

## Code Design Considerations

### Environment Component Structure

```typescript
// Environment base class for common functionality
class Environment {
  protected scene: Scene;
  protected assets: Map<string, Mesh>;
  protected lights: Light[];
  protected navMesh: Mesh;
  
  constructor(scene: Scene) {
    this.scene = scene;
    this.assets = new Map();
    this.lights = [];
  }
  
  async load(): Promise<void> {
    // Load environment assets
  }
  
  createNavMesh(): void {
    // Generate navigation mesh for AI pathfinding
  }
  
  setupLighting(): void {
    // Set up environment lighting
  }
}

// Training facility implementation
class TrainingFacility extends Environment {
  private interactiveElements: Map<string, InteractiveElement>;
  
  constructor(scene: Scene) {
    super(scene);
    this.interactiveElements = new Map();
  }
  
  async load(): Promise<void> {
    await super.load();
    // Load training facility specific assets
    await this.setupTrainingZones();
  }
  
  private async setupTrainingZones(): Promise<void> {
    // Set up shooting range, movement course, etc.
  }
  
  createTargetPractice(position: Vector3): void {
    // Create interactive target practice element
  }
}
```

## Questions and Clarifications

1. **Level Design Approach**: Should we create the training facility as a single large environment or as modular sections that can be loaded independently?

2. **Performance Targets**: What are the specific performance targets for the environment (polygon count, draw calls, etc.)?

3. **Art Style**: How closely should the environment visually match GoldenEye 64? Should we use a more modern aesthetic while maintaining the layout inspiration?

4. **Interactive Elements**: What specific interactive elements should be included in the training facility?
